        <p>The latitudinal gradient in species richness is one of the best-known patterns in ecology. Most people know that there are more species in the tropics than in temperate or boreal latitudes. During my Master thesis I have been testing two hypothesis which tryed to explain the mechanistic base leading to the latitudinal gradient in species richness. These were (1) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth and (2) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range.</p>

<p>(1) The latitudinal niche breadth hypothesis states that species at low latitudes have narrower niches. Therefore, the tropics are more species-rich because more species can fit into the same environmental space. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have larger niches, so fewer species would fit into the same environmental space. This hypothesis is quite intuitive and attractive. For example, it is intuitive that species that occur in boreal latitudes where there are large seasonal temperature variations (e.g. in Siberia the average temperature ranges from -37 °C in January to 19.5 °C in July) should have a much larger niche in terms of temperature than tropical species that have very little seasonal temperature variation (e.g. in Singapore the average temperature ranges from 26 °C in January to 28 °C in June).</p>

<p>(2) The second hypothesis, the hypothesis of the existence of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range range (also known as “Rapoport’s rule”), states that species at low latitudes have a narrow latitudinal range, while species at higher latitudes have a larger latitudinal range range. In other words, a tropical species is likely to have a strictly tropical distribution, while a boreal species might be widely distributed also in temperate latitudes.</p>

<p>Hypotheses about the latitudinal gradient of species richness have been formulated many times in the last century, but there have been few testing approaches, mostly because of the lack of global ecological data. Now more and more global ecological data is available, and I have been able to test these hypotheses on more almost 30 000 plant species worldwide.</p>

<p>To do this, I generated species distribution models from speceis occurrence data and 9 environmental variables. In simple words, the model looks at the environmental conditions under which a species is known to occur and learns under which conditions the species is most likely to occur. Using these models, I calculated the environmental breadth of the species by comparing the variance of environmental conditions in the area where the species is expected to occur with those where the species is not expected to occur.</p>

<p>… to be continued (the project developed and I am analysing the new data!)</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the reading! Should you be more interested into the topic, reach out, I am always happy to talk about it  :)</p>
