Most people know that there are more species in the tropics than in temperate or boreal latitudes. During my Master thesis I have been testing two hypothesis which tryed to explain the mechanistic base leading to the latitudinal gradient in species richness. These were (1) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth and (2) the hypothesis of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range.</p>

<p>(1) The latitudinal niche breadth hypothesis states that species at low latitudes have narrower niches. Therefore, the tropics are more species-rich because more species can fit into the same environmental space. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have larger niches, so fewer species would fit into the same environmental space. This hypothesis is quite intuitive and attractive. For example, it is intuitive that species that occur in boreal latitudes where there are large seasonal temperature variations (e.g. in Siberia the average temperature ranges from -37 °C in January to 19.5 °C in July) should have a much larger niche in terms of temperature than tropical species that have very little seasonal temperature variation (e.g. in Singapore the average temperature ranges from 26 °C in January to 28 °C in June).</p>

<p>(2) The second hypothesis, the hypothesis of the existence of a latitudinal gradient in latitudinal range range (also known as “Rapoport’s rule”), states that species at low latitudes have a narrow latitudinal range, while species at higher latitudes have a larger latitudinal range range. In other words, a tropical species is likely to have a strictly tropical distribution, while a boreal species might be widely distributed also in temperate latitudes.</p>

<p>Hypotheses about the latitudinal gradient of species richness have been formulated many times in the last century, but there have been few testing approaches, mostly because of the lack of global ecological data. Now more and more global ecological data is available, and I have been able to test these hypotheses on more almost 30 000 plant species worldwide.</p>

<p>To do this, I generated species distribution models from speceis occurrence data and 9 environmental variables. In simple words, the model looks at the environmental conditions under which a species is known to occur and learns under which conditions the species is most likely to occur. Using these models, I calculated the environmental breadth of the species by comparing the variance of environmental conditions in the area where the species is expected to occur with those where the species is not expected to occur.</p>

<p>… to be continued (the project developed and I am analysing the new data!)</p>

In fact, in oder to understand the mechanisms of the evolution of sex chromosomes younger study systems are needed. During this project, I used a double-digest Restriction site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach coupled to a privacy rarefaction analysis to detect sex-specific genetic markers in the evolutionary young <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex.</p>

<p>Dioecy is relatively rare in the plant kingdom. In fact, only 5-6% of angiosperm plant species have separate male and female plants. The genus <em>Silene</em> is a particularly well suited model system to study sex chromosome evolution. <em>Silene latifolia</em> has been intensively studies in this regards. Dioecy has however appeared several times indipendently within the genus and the <em>Silene acaulis</em> species complex, given its particular biogeography, is quite exciting to analyze. In fact, within the complex, several sexual systems appear to exist: <em>Silene acaulis subsp. cenisia</em> and <em>Silene acaulis subsp. acaulis</em> being triecious while <em>Silene acaulis subsp. exscapa</em> being diecious. Even hybrids between these species can be found and the species are known to have adapted to different edaphic conditions.</p>

<p>RAD-seq has already been used successfully several times in order to detect sex-specific markers and sex chromosome systems. It has the advantages of (1) generating sequence data which can effortlessly be tested in PCR validations and (2) there is no need of a fully sequenced reference genome. The ddRAD approach was chosen as the use of two distinct restriction enzymes normally produces a lower quantity of markers compared to RAD-seq and allows thus the multiplexing of more samples in one sequencing lane.</p>

<p>My results indicate a very promising female-specific genetic marker within <em>Silene exscapa</em>! This is exciting because it indicates a system in which chromosomal sex determination is different from a simple Y-hemizygous system. In such a system, males would also have one copy of the X chromosome and thus a marker specific to the female sex (two X chomosomes and no Y) is unlikely. The results suggest a W-hemizygous system, as in this case with the females being hemizygous the location of the female specific marker could be on the W chromosome and thus never appear in male individuals as it would only be maternally inherited. If the system would be W-hemizygous, heterozygotes would need the information present on the W chromosome in order to be able to carry out the female reproductive functions.</p>

<p>The detected top-candidate marker encodes for a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (PPR) protein. These proteins are abundant among terrestrial plants, are RNA-binding and have their physiological role in mitochondria or chloroplasts. This top-candidate marker could however not only be a simple marker, as it might play a central role in the very sex-determination mechanisms.</p>

<p>Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a trait which determines the production of sterile pollen and the consequently loss of the male reproductive function of normally hermaphroditic plants. This trait is determined by the plant mitochondrial genome. However, this condition can be suppressed by carrying nuclear genes called restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes. The majority of studies about CMS has identified Rf genes that encode proteins of the PPR family. Thus, the identified marker could play a role in CMS, however it could also simply be a female-specific PPR protein not involved in CMS. In any way, having identified a potential female-specific sex-marker which belongs to a protein family often associated to cytoplasmic male sterility seems contradictory, is very exciting and seems worthy of further investigations.</p>
