I am a quantitative ecologist fascinated by the diversity of life forms that our planet harbours. I am particularly interested on how biotic and abiotic factors influence the distribution of life on Earth. In particular, I am interested in strong experimental approach, which allow conclusions to the generalised at a global scale and have applicable outcomes. 

I have a particularly strong interest in peatland restoration, as I am fascinated by the atmosphere created by these habitats but also because their restoration represents one of the most powerful tools humankind has to address the current biodiversity and climate crises. In fact, peatlands occupy only 3% of the terrestrial surface but store more than 44% of the global soil carbon, accounting thus for more than twice all the carbon stored in forests. Peatlands are among the most threatened ecosystems in Europe and their regeneration process offers unique opportunities to study fundamental ecological questions addressing topics such as species dispersal, ecological connectivity, evolutionary bottlenecks, island biogeography, and many more.

Currently I am working modelling the distribution of species and their envirnmental breadth in order to test fundamental hypotheses describing the distribution of species richness on Earth. You can see a description of the project [here](https://marco-barandun.github.io/ecology/research/2022/12/07/latitudinal-species-richness-gradient.html).

In my free time I enjoy botanising, really like diving, love cooking and good books. As this page exists, I apparently have a weak spot for coding as well...
